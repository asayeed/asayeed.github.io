title: Web games for adversarial communication
---
The political concept of "dogwhistling" in English is the use of
language by politicians to use the same utterances to send different
intended messages to different groups, e.g., to mislead the media
about what they mean, while signalling a "real" message to a base of
core followers "in the know", so to speak.

A similar strategy is represented by the popular board game "Dixit",
where players are rewarded for deceiving SOME of their competitors
about the identity of an abstract image BUT NOT ALL of their
competitors -- indeed, they are	penalized if they deceive none OR ALL
of their competitors.

This project is	about taking the first steps to	learn models of	what
might be called "adversarial communication" using human-identified
image features.	 We will design	an online interface intended to
collect such features in the context of	a game against a computer
using a generative adversarial network (GAN) or reinforcement learning
strategy, as appropriate.
