title: Predicting word characteristics in conversational context
---
Words being more and less predictable in context have an effect on
speaker behaviour -- for example, taking longer to pronounce a word in
order to enable the listener to more easily recognize it.  The factors
of predictability in conversational behaviour are challenging to
identify. Very simple language models (machine-learned models of
sequences) have been used to demonstrate the effect of predictability,
but more sophisticated models that take into account syntax and
semantics may provide more explanatory power.

This project involves applying recent machine learning techniques,
particularly neural language modeling, to model effects of
predictability over transcribed conversational text in existing
collections (e.g. AMI Corpus). This is part of an international collaboration
with Prof. Vera Demberg at Saarland University, Germany.
