title: Reinforcement learning for semantic partitioning
---
You can think of meaning in language as a kind of "blob" that is
roughly partitioned by words. The partitions vary in clarity --
"table" is clearly different from "flower" but less different from
"countertop".  Different languages partition the space differently,
but people have hypothesized that there are common elements in this
partitioning.  For example, there are countless ways to divide up the
space of possible colours by words, but languages seem to converge on
the same partitioning -- a similar arrangement of colour terms.

This project is about using machine learning techniques, particularly
deep reinforcement learning in an agent-based paradigm, to simulate
how language communities might arrive at a common partitioning of the
"meaning blob" into words, based on theories of cognition and
communication. In cooperation with Prof. Devdatt Dubhashi at Chalmers.
