title: Relative cardinality	of common objects
---
In the sentence, "Every	pedestrian held	an umbrella", most English-speakers
would assume that there	was one	umbrella per pedestrian, even though the syntax
allows for there to be a single	umbrella held by every pedestrian at once.
On the other hand, "Every pilgrim visited a shrine" allows for a plausible interpretation
that all the pilgrims visited a	single shrine.	Some combination of experience and
common sense allows language users to assign relative probable set cardinalities
to different pairs of objects: e.g. "pedestrian ~ umbrella"	while "pilgrim >	shrine".

This project will attempt to use deep learning techniques over textual and image data sources
as well	as data	collected from human experiments in order to build a preliminary general model
of relative set	cardinality assignment,	in the context of universal quantifiers	like "every".
