title: Learning typical locations for action words
---
Computers can be trained to recognize typical participants in action
events in written language, such as instruments -- "knife" is a
typical instrument of "cutting". "Cake" is also something that is
typically cut (a "patient" of "cutting").

Humans are able to identify "cooking" as an action that typically
takes place in a "kitchen", or that a "kitchen" is *for* cooking. The
problem is, other things can happen in a kitchen. Computers have
particular difficulty with identifying typical location-action
relationships in language -- in existing work that mainly relies on
machine learning over large volumes of text.

This project is about exploring ways to enhance typical location
prediction through machine learning techniques (e.g. deep learning,
reinforcement learning, etc) by adding image data to textual data and
is part of an international collaboration with Prof. Vera Demberg at
Saarland University.
