title: Identifying participants for noun-based events
---
A "nominal predicate" is an action represented as a noun rather than a
verb -- for example, "destruction" is a noun representing the same
type of event that the verb "destroy" represents.  Something can
destroy a city -- we can thereafter refer to that as "the destruction
of the city."  Unlike verbs, however, nominal predicates can omit all
mention of the events participants, leaving them implicit ("There was
destruction everywhere.")  Machine understanding of texts still
requires the ability to	identify the implicit participants of a	
nominal	predicate.

This project will seek to develop, combine, and	improve	new and	existing
machine	learning models	of nominal predicate identification. The training
and testing data come from existing large English text corpora.
